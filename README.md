# Variational Quantum Eigenvector Search

This repository contains the code used for the paper [Certified variational quantum algorithms for eigenstate preparation](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052610).

The file *eigenvector_search.ipynb* is used to produce the main plots (Figures 1-5).
The file *ising-ham-trotter-error-study.ipynb* is used for study the error of the Trotter decomposition (Figure 6 in the paper).
