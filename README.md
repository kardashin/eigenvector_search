# Variational Quantum Eigenvector Search

This repository contains the code used for the paper [Certified variational quantum algorithms for eigenstate preparation](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052610).

The file *eigenvector_search.ipynb* is used to produce the main plots.
The file *error_study.ipynb* is used for study the error of Suzuki-Trotter decomposition (Fig. 6 in the  paper).
